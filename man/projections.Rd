\title{Run simulations of a marine mammal population with bycatch mortality}
\usage{
projections(
  NOut,
  ConstantBycatch = list(Catch = NA, CV = NA),
  ConstantRateBycatch = list(Rate = NA, CV = NA),
  InitDepl,
  lh.params,
  nyears,
  obs_CV = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NOut}{number of simulations}

\item{ConstantBycatch}{Mean and CV of number of animals killed as bycatch per year (assumed lognormal)}

\item{ConstantRateBycatch}{Mean and CV of bycatch rate (assumed normal)}

\item{InitDepl}{initial depletion. If obs_CV>0, this is the mean depletion.}

\item{lh.params}{- life history parameters as a list. The list must include S0, S1plus, K1plus, AgeMat, nages, z, and lambdaMax}

\item{nyears}{number of years to do projections}

\item{obs_CV}{observation CV. Default to 1 for simple projections}
}
\value{
list of outputs from simulations: \code{params} contains parameter values for each trajectory as a matrix; \code{trajectories} contains simulation outputs as a matrix; \code{fishing.rates} contain the bycatch rates for each year in each simulation as a matrix; \code{InitDepl} returns the initial depletion for the projections; \code{ConstantBycatch} provides Catch (total individuals killed in bycatch events per year) and CV of Catch (if the user has specified bycatch as a constant number); \code{ConstantRateBycatch} contains Bycatch Rate (additional mortality from bycatch each year) and CV of ByCatch rate. Other parameters are the same as in the \code{dynamics()} function.
}
\description{
Generates several projections, stochasticity is in the number of catches from year to year
