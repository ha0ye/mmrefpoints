\title{Calculate the bycatch rate needed to reach a performance goal}
\usage{
rebuild_by_x(
  needf.start,
  init.depl.w,
  goal.w,
  desired.prob.w,
  when.w,
  lh.params.w,
  fixed.cv.catch.w
)
}
\arguments{
\item{needf.start}{Starting guess for the bycatch mortality rate needed to recover the population}

\item{init.depl.w}{Initial depletion (a fraction)}

\item{goal.w}{Population size goal (number of whales or pinnipeds) to rebuild to, expressed as a whole number}

\item{desired.prob.w}{What probability you want (e.g., 0.75 probability that the population will rebuild to X in Y years)}

\item{when.w}{The year Y when rebuilding is desired by (number of years into future; current year = 0)}

\item{lh.params.w}{A list of life history parameters used by \code{projections()}}

\item{fixed.cv.catch.w}{The CV of the bycatch rate - should be fixed}
}
\value{
The bycatch rate that will result in the specified rebuilding goal. If Shiny is running, it will return a list containing the bycatch rate \code{f} and a matrix of guesses that \code{optim()} has searched through to find the solution.
}
\description{
Takes a performance goal (what level you want to rebuild to) and a time window (how long you want that to take) and calculates what the bycatch rate needs to be
}
